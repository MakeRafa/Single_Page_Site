                <h2>Diablo Lake</h2>
                <p>
                    The lake is on the border of Washington State and Canada inside the North Cascade mountains, if you hike up to the top 
                    of those mountains you will be able to see them nice Canadians grocery shopping from afar. Although the lake is beautiful 
                    it is as cold as an ice bath because of the glacier water from the mountains surrounding it. It is a popular kayaking area 
                    and there are various viewpoints. For families that want to get away for a week or two or forever, 
                    North Cascades Environmental Learning Center offers families getaway vacations at Diablo Lake. I had the opportunity to 
                    attend a getaway myself at Diablo Lake, funded by my high school, and it was an unforgettable experience.

                <h2>Colchuck Lake</h2>
                <p> 
                    In between two enourmos peaks in Washington State lies the magical Colchuck Lake. If you are up for a difficult work out that has your legs shaking 
                    afterwards then the visiting this lake is the one for you. At an elevation of 5500' you can feel the difference in air pressure. 
                    The hike there and back is a whopping 13km, so the next expect your body to ache or soreness. The lake itself is absolutely stunning 
                    on a sunny day, with no clouds you will be able  to see the mountain behind the lake. Although, do not be fooled, you might be 
                    soaking in sweat once you arrive to a viewpoint, but the water is not warm one bit in case you think of jumping in.

                    <h2>Oregon Coast</h2>
                    <p> 
                        The only thing better than the state of Oregon itself is its coast. Stretching at about 580km, there are plenty of
                        towns to visit and trails to hike. The most enjoyable time to visit is during the summer, when the beaches are full
                        and the sun stays up all night. For all you sport fanatics, you wont want to miss the famous and record setting Seaside Beach
                        Volleyball Tournament. For anyone who enjoys to swim just remember that just because the sun is out does not mean the 
                        water is to. While you are out there don't forget to fill up, if I could only recommend one place that says "Oregon Coast" in 
                        one bite, then The Fish Peddler at Pacific Oyster seals the deal.
